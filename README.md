the other player has to tell him if he hit any of the enemy troops or not. 
the winner will be the one who manages to keep his ships afloat until the end.
Now, our main task is to be able to make a fully playable version of the game, but executed 
but executed from the Python programming language, where before getting down to work we have to take into account the challenges of 
before getting down to work, we must take into account the challenges of making this “Pythonian” copy.
First of all, the most important element of the game, the board. We need to build 
the board for the user and for the machine, which should be a 5x5 matrix, where the first thing to do is to ask the user for the coordinates 
is to ask the user for the coordinates, since our goal is to generate the coordinates of the machine randomly. 
randomly.
Having already completed the first objective, which are the boards, the next goal for us is to be able to show the user the coordinates of the machine in a random way. 
the next goal for us is to be able to show the user, and in turn, to ask him which coordinates he wants to attack in his 
the respective turn, representing in a visual way, if he missed or if he succeeded in the attack, as well as to show which parts of his 
the attack, as well as showing which parts of the board were attacked.
Continuing with the attacks, we need to instruct the machine how to attack in a random way, so that after 
randomly, so that after each user's turn, it proceeds with its turn attacking any part of the player's board, until it 
any part of the player's board, until one of the 2 loses.
Finally, as a last objective, we require that when the 3 ships of one of the 2 players are destroyed, we require that when the 3 ships of one of the 2 players are 
3 ships of any of the 2 players, it is visually shown, the victory or defeat that the user suffers, showing some 
the user suffers, showing some graphic that deserves it.
